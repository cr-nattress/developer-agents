Create the initial folder structure for a Python application that automates Git operations through multiple agents. The folders should be:

- `tools/` for low-level Git, GitHub, and sandbox functions
- `core/` for agent logic and orchestration
- `prompts/` for any template messages used by LLMs
- `context/` for shared state and configuration
- `output/` for result handling and logs
- `tests/` for unit tests

Use empty `__init__.py` files in each folder to make them Python packages.
